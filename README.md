# Coming soon

`up-cli` lets you push and deploy a project quickly to a remote server with [`up-serve`](https://github.com/codefeathers/up-serve). It will be built using `nodeJS`.

This is a placeholder repo for the `up-cli` project coming soon. Meanwhile, you can do this on the server with [`up-serve`](https://github.com/codefeathers/up-serve).
